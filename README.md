# Brief introduction:

Hello there, folks! I'm Ken, the keyboard maestro from TPE Auckland, with a passion for programming and a penchant for puns. I'm fluent in "Elglish" - the unique blend of English and coding jargon that keeps me in stitches and debugging at the same time. When I'm not busy debugging my code, you'll likely find me on a hike, touching grass, or cracking a joke that only fellow programmers would understand. So, let's code and conquer the world one line at a time! Cheers, mate!
