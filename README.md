# Brief introduction:

G'day, mates! I'm Ken, the coding whiz hailing from TPE- Auckland, where I spin web magic with my keyboard. Fluent in "Elglish," the art of coding lingo and nerd jokes, I'm all about turning bugs into features and debugging with a smile. When I'm not tapping away on my keyboard, you'll likely find me tinkering with gadgets or cracking puns that'll make you groan and grin at the same time. So, let's code and conquer the digital realm together! Cheers, cobbers!
