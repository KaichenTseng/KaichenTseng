# Brief introduction:

I'm a developer, and I now reside in Auckland. Since I was little, I've always thought that people should be more creative than spending time using social media. I discovered my passion in design when I was young. I also discovered that designing gadgets is another method for me to express my thoughts to the world; in addition, I'm now sharpening my coding abilities. I also find a special connection between me and retro technologies. These are some of the skills I've acquired on topics of interest that I've discovered during the past ten years. I also became interested in film-making and landscape photography. I also love spending my weekends on train trips or going climbing in the mountains as a way to decompress after a stressful work week.
